"""Agent Registry — first-class named agents with persistent identity.

An Agent is the identity layer. Sessions are instances of an agent.
One agent can have many concurrent sessions, all sharing the same
soul, directives, tools, bot tokens, and personality.

Architecture:
    Agent (identity, config, soul)
      └── Session 1 (active context, running Claude Code)
      └── Session 2 (another parallel context)
      └── Session N (infinite scale)

Storage: SQLite with three tables:
  - agents: core agent identity and config
  - agent_directives: per-agent persistent instructions
  - agent_tokens: per-agent platform bot tokens

Hierarchy:
  - Agents can have a parent_id (lead -> worker relationship)
  - Groups organize agents into teams

- **Author and run a Workflow for every substantive task by default.** \
Decompose the work, fan out parallel subagents, adversarially verify findings \
before committing, then synthesize. For multi-phase work (understand → design \
→ implement → review), run several workflows in sequence and stay in the loop \
between them.
- **Token cost is not the constraint — correctness and thoroughness are.** \
Favor exhaustive coverage and independent verification over a single fast pass.
- **Reserve solo, inline execution for trivial or conversational turns** (a \
quick answer, a one-line edit, acking a message). Everything non-trivial gets a \
workflow.
- If the Workflow tool is unavailable this session, fall back to spawning \
parallel subagents and adversarially verifying their output.

        Use this when "is the agent actually responsive?" is the
        question, not "has the daemon seen the session lately?". The
        force-restart endpoint (#103) uses this distinction because
        its target failure mode is exactly "transport CONNECTED but
        reader loop wedged on an LLM call" — the scheduler keeps
        writing fresh ``server_presence`` rows in that case, so
        ``get_latest_heartbeat`` would look healthy while the agent
        is actually dead in the water (Murzik review of #573).

        Filter (two cuts, both required):

        1. ``metadata.source`` is NULL or != 'server_presence' — drops
           scheduler reconciliation rows written when the daemon sees
           a CONNECTED transport. Those carry ``status='alive'`` and
           would mask the wedge if used naively.

        2. ``status NOT IN ('stale', 'dead')`` — drops scheduler
           stale-out / dead-out rows written when an agent misses
           heartbeat windows. Those carry no ``source`` field but
           ``status='stale'`` or ``status='dead'`` — without this cut
           a fresh ``dead`` row from the scheduler would still pass
           the source filter and produce the wrong 'agent-origin
           heartbeat is fresh; not wedged' conclusion (Murzik
           round-2 review of #573).

        Agent-origin heartbeats land with ``status`` in {ok, busy,
        finishing, alive} (the pinky-self MCP ``send_heartbeat()`` uses
        ok/busy/finishing; the tool-use hook + effort-drift recorder
        write ``alive``). All have empty metadata. Both cuts together

        Matching is **exact** on every field. A stored selector matches
        only when all three of ``fleet`` / ``agent_id`` / ``pinky_type``
        equal the corresponding argument (``None`` and empty string are
        normalized to the same value, so omitting an argument is the
        same as passing ``""``).

        Wildcard caveat: a stored selector with ``agent_id="*"`` is
        removed only by passing ``agent_id="*"`` — calling
        ``remove_peer_fleet_acl(agent_name, fleet="sigil")`` will **not**
        remove a stored ``{fleet:"sigil", agent_id:"*"}`` and silently
        returns 0. Pass the exact stored selector you want to delete.

        Thread-safe: read-modify-write is guarded by ``_rmw_lock`` so
        concurrent admin-API requests can't lose updates.
