"""Shared structured-log schema for the watchdog decision points (#230).

All three watchdog paths emit ONE consistent ``key=value`` line so decisions are
greppable and auditable side-by-side:

  * the per-session in-flight watchdog (``TmuxSession._inflight_watchdog`` —
    force_restart / growing / idle-reconcile),
  * the daemon ``SessionWatchdog`` (warn / recover / inflight-skip), and
  * the scheduler idle-sleep (``_check_idle_sessions`` — sleep / inflight-skip).

The schema (key set + ordering + rounding) lives here, in ONE place, while each
path keeps its own decision logic and passes only the fields it has. Centralising
the schema — not the decisions — is the shape Murzik signed off on for #230: a
reader greps ``watchdog_decision`` and sees the same keys from every path.
