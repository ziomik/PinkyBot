"""Tmux transcript tailer — response capture pipeline for ``TmuxSession``.

PR8b of the #486 sequence. Closes the response-capture gap left open by
PR8a (#495). Design proposal: ``docs/design/tmux-response-pipeline.md``.

## What this module does

Claude Code's interactive REPL appends one JSONL entry per event to
``~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl``. Inside that
stream are:

- ``{"type": "user", ...}`` — inbound prompt or tool result
- ``{"type": "assistant", "message": {"content": [...]}, ...}`` — one
  model API call's output. Multiple of these can appear inside a single
  conversational turn (tool-use loops).
- ``{"type": "system", "subtype": "stop_hook_summary", ...}`` — written
  by Claude Code itself after the configured ``Stop`` hooks complete.
  This is the authoritative turn-end marker.

``TmuxTranscriptTailer`` watches the file from a byte offset, accumulates
each assistant entry's text / thinking / tool_use blocks into a
``_TurnBuffer``, and fires ``on_turn_complete(TurnResponse)`` when it
sees a ``stop_hook_summary`` entry.

## Hybrid wake model

The tailer normally polls at ``_FALLBACK_POLL_SEC`` so it makes progress
even without external signals. ``wake()`` short-circuits the poll —
callers wire that to a ``Stop`` hook that POSTs to the daemon, giving
near-zero latency on turn-end while keeping the file as single source of
truth. See module docstring in ``tmux_session.py`` and the design doc
for the full rationale.

## Why this is its own module (not folded into TmuxSession)

Two reasons:

1. **Reuse.** Context-budget watchdog and conversation-store backfill
   both need to read the same transcripts. A standalone tailer is the
   shared primitive; ``TmuxSession`` is one consumer.
2. **Testability.** The tailer is a pure function of (file content, wake
   events) → callback invocations. Unit-testable without any tmux /
   claude / asyncio session setup.

        repoint the tailer at the canonical transcript Claude Code is
        writing to, and by the #515 self-heal mtime-scan when the
        SessionStart hook never fires.

        Seeks to end-of-file by default — Pushok's PR #496 round-1
        Case 3 fix. The previous design unconditionally reset offset to
        0, which was safe ONLY under the contract that SessionStart
        fires before any turns. If that contract is ever violated
        (compact-resume swap, daemon-restart mid-session re-fire,
        misconfigured test fixture, late-arriving hook on a session
        that already produced turns), reading from 0 would re-fire
        every historical turn's ``response_callback`` — reply-spam to
        every chat that ever talked to this agent.

        Seek-to-EOF gives the same offset==0 for a fresh file
        (size == 0) and bounds the replay risk for non-fresh.

        ``seek_to_start=True`` overrides the default and seeks to byte
        0. The self-heal discovery path uses this when transitioning
        from a placeholder (non-existent file) to a freshly-discovered
        transcript: in that case the daemon has never read any bytes
        for this session, the JSONL was created seconds ago specifically
        for this cold-start, and we want every entry from byte 0
        forward. The reply-spam risk applies to long-lived transcripts
        with prior turns, not to fresh-discovery files.

        Callers that want backfill semantics (re-read the whole file)
        can call ``set_offset(0)`` after this method — that's what the
        backfill code path is for and it's an explicit choice rather
        than an accidental side effect. ``seek_to_start`` is the
        in-method shorthand for the discovery case.

        Pushok's PR #496 round-2 Case 2': also drain the in-memory turn
        buffer. The buffer accumulates assistant entries between
        ``stop_hook_summary`` markers, so a session that was killed
        mid-turn (e.g. force_restart) can leave partial text in the
        buffer. If we swap to a new session's transcript without
        draining, the next ``stop_hook_summary`` we read would surface
